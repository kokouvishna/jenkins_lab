# Jenkins based projects

## [Project 1](/project_1/)
In this project we'll build and deploy a java based application. We build the application with maven
and deploy it using docker.
The java application is a fully fledged application with a frontent, backend and database.
 
We're going to build this application using maven. We'll also have stages for sonarqube, quality check, 
OS depedency check, and trivy file system scanning. In addition we'll be building the application using maven
and deploying the jar artifacts to nexus third party repository. Nexus is a third party repository manager tool that host
multiple versions of your artifacts.
We'll also be using docker to build the docker image, tag it and push it to a docker hub repository.
At least we'll be deploying the application inside a docker container.
